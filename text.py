                4. Which Countries have the highest Fully Vaccinated Rates?
                5. Does a Country's GDP play a role in the Vaccination rate across its population?
                6. Is percentage of vaccinated dependent on population size of countries?
            """

Conclusion = """
                From the analysis and visualization done, two things we can conclude on are: 
                - the vaccination percentage rate is independent of total population size but 
                    instead dependent on inidvidual's country's access to vaccines.
                - vaccines are more accessible in higher income countries (based on GNI per capita) 
                    than lower income countries.
